## Overview
Alarm Central Station Receiver is a python based project for receiving notifications from home alarm systems via the Contact-ID protocol.  It monitors for an incoming phone calls from the home alarm, and relays events via email.

## Required Hardware

To operate, the software requires a USB FXO that includes DTMF decoding.  I've ended up using the original verison of the Magic Jack USB adapater (the silver one with a clear window into the circuit board).  You can find them very cheap on eBay, and, at least on Debian has driver support as a generic headset.
